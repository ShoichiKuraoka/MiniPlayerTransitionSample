I recently got my computer science degree and I decided to finish my studies and get a software engineering and thankfully I was lucky enough to be chosen by a program hosted by Proxym-Group where I had the chance to to finish my studies and work as junior Front-End Developer , To give a quick summary, the company builds software for clients with differents backgrounds mostly governments and banks.
And here I am Waiting for my first task . my company is using Apache Cordova to develop their mobile apps but Apache Cordova had a lot of drawbacks so they decided to search for an Alternative and their choice was Flutter . So I had to make a case study about flutter And learn how to use this framework .
To be honest I wasn’t happy with that decision at the time I hated leaving my comfort zone since all I knew was HTML ,CSS, Javascript and my favorite framework Vue.js And I had no experience developing Mobile application . It is like someone took you away for your mother warm uterus and just gave you a slap and send you to the world .
I’m not going to compare Flutter to these Cross-Platform mobile technologies In this article .

Learning Flutter
I had only 1 month to Learn this framework and come with answers to different topics, and here the journey begins .

1.Setup
It was easy to get setup. Flutter provides good documentation which details all the required steps.

2.Dart
At first Dart had the feeling of Java and I really hated strongly typed languages(I wasn’t fun of java in college ) But by the time Dart became a lovely language to develop in .He had the flexibility of Javascript and strong like Java working with Asynchronous programming with async/await/Future is a breeze, and it also feels complete and consistent . This was my first experience of it and I found it familiar and intuitive. It’s a fresh and modern feeling language. And being a compiled “ahead of time” (AOT) into native code for multiple platforms, eliminated the need for a JavaScript bridge and improving performance.
Although it is missing some features that I have come to love (In Javascript world ).The documentation is rich and it’s all you need To learn it

3. Architecture and state management patterns
After learning dart the first thing I was looking for was design patterns and the best way to structure your code in flutter and this one Was really hard since Flutter is a new technology .
Some people follow the business logic component pattern (BLOC)Or Redux for Flutter But thought it’s a bit unnecessarily complex.
So I decided to pick up The Scoped-Model geared with RxDart since I come from the Web World and this was closest to the architectures I knew .
